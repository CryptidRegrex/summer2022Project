# summer2022Project
Composed of work for Software Engineering Introduction class over summer of 2022

This code is for our JavaWeb Application MASS (Muscle Associated Self-Scheduler). Users login into our web app and can build their own customizable workouts. These workouts are added to the user's schedule within the application. Users can view their schedule for the week. Their current workout session can be select, and users can checkoff scheduled exercises as they complete them. 

Release Notes Milestone 1:
  Basic UI has been developed with navigation between the main pages. This UI still needs to be adjusted to look the same on different browsers and displays.
  A login system has been created where users must sign into an existing account or create a new one.
  A basic "build a workout" page has been created. A user can fill out a form, and the exercises that correspond with their requests will be returned (currently returned   with the appropriate workoutID from the database). 
  
  
Release Notes Milestone 2:
  JUnit tests have been created for the Login/Create New User system. This tests that a user can't outright break the system with bad user input. 
  The "build a workout" page has been built out with all user input features expected. This includes each input a user needs to add to help them determine the right workout for them.
  The UI has been updated and standardized across all browsers and any errors before with the UI have been smoothed out.

Release Notes Milestone 3:
JUnit tests have been added for the Checklist.java and Calender.java classes.
The "build a workout has been fully fleshed out and the calender has been created with all features desired.
Checklist has also been created with all features desired, but still needs some more test cases and UI formatting.
Practical testing has been completed.
